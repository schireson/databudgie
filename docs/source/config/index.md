# Config

To first get a sense of what databudgie config looks like, here is a basic example
configuration with both backup and restore defined.

```yaml
backup:
  url: postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres
  tables:
    - name: public.product
      query: "select * from {table} where store_id = 4"
      location: s3://my-s3-bucket/databudgie/public.product
restore:
  url: postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres
  tables:
    - name: public.product
      query: "select * from {table} where store_id = 4"
      location: s3://my-s3-bucket/databudgie/public.product
```

The backup and restore configuration options are intentionally identical in nearly
all cases. Generally, you can assume any option given for one will be available
for the other, except when specifically noted otherwise.

```{toctree}
precedence
interpolation
backup_restore
table
ddl
manifest
```
